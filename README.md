# EscapeTheAkatsuki

This is a **Naruto Object-Oriented Game** I made during my time at the Concordia Web Development program!

It was initially a Nyan Cat game with no features and a bunch of errors in the code. It was our job to create a game about something we liked!

Adding layers of difficulty to the game made it more interesting and it was very fun to make.

Every 30 seconds the speed of the kunai's increase and every 25% of damage you take to your health, Naruto becomes more bloody and bruised.

The game is being hosted on Netlify and you may play the game directly here : https://escape-the-akatsuki.netlify.app/
